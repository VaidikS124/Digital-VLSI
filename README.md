Description: 1) Designed a 3-input XOR/NXOR logic gate using CPL (Complementary pass-transistor logic) logic style at 1GHz with load capacitance of 500 fF. 
2) Designed a Machine which can detect 3 consecutive heads in a sequence of random trials of tossing fair coin. Used one hot assignment for defining the states.
